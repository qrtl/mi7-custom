This module does the following:

- When customer invoice that meets all of the following conditions is
  validated, Odoo will print and send the invoice to the followers of
  the document.
  - 'Send Invoice upon Validation' is set in the workflow process linked
    to the invoice.
  - 'Not Auto-send Invoice' of the pikcing linked to the invoice is not
    selected.
  - 'Not Auto-send Invoice' of the payment term assigned to the invoice
    is not selected.
  - 'Invoice Sent' is not flagged (the field is flagged when the invoice
    is sent by the module logic).

The module depends on the OCA module sale_automatic_workflow.
