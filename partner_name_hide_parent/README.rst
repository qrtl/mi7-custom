This module does the following:

-  Adds the ability to hide parent's name from the presentation of the
   partners' names according to the settings of the partners. The
   function provided by this module is needed when you have to set up a
   child partner (e.g. a branch office of a company) as an 'individual'
   due to how Odoo recognizes the commercial partner (i.e. if a child
   partner is a 'company', the partner becomes the commercial partner
   itself), and you do not want to show the parent's name in QWeb report
   or website where the partner is referenced (if the child partner is
   an individual, Odoo by default shows the parent's name preceding the
   child's name).
