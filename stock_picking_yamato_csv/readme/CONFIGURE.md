Following settings should be updated:

- Shipper Code (in warehouse)
- Carrier Code (in warehouse)
- Delivery Time Category (in delivery time)

Carrier Code can also be set in the shipping partner - when a delivery
is created, Carrier Code in the delivery is defaulted from the shipping
partner if there is a value set, otherwise from the warehouse.
