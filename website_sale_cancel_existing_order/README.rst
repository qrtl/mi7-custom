This module does the following:

- Cancels other existing sales orders of the user when an order is created in the shop
  frontend operation.

There are cases where a new order is created while there is an existing order (i.e. user
added a product to the cart as a public user, and then logged in while he/she had
already added something in the cart), which could lead to some problematic behaviors
such as the user seeing products in the cart right after processing an order.
