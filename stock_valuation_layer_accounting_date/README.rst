This module adds Accounting Date field in stock.valuation.layer,
enabling the report output based on this field.

Accounting Date is computed (and stored in the record) based on the
following logic:

-  If a journal entry linked to the stock.valuation.layer record, take
   the date of the journal entry.
-  Otherwise, convert create_date (datetime) of the
   stock.valuation.layer record to date, with consideration to user's
   timezone.

Usage
=====

1. Go to *Inventory > Reporting > Inventory Valuation* and click
   'Inventory at Date'.
2. In the wizard, select a date in 'Inventory at Date', and click
   'Valuation as of Accounting Date' (note that 'hh:mm:ss' part of the
   selection in 'Inventory at Date' is ignored in this context).
