This module does the following:

- Hides 'Be notified when back in stock' button in the wishlist
- Disables the cron 'Wishlist: send email regarding products
  availability'.
- Adjusts the logic to not select stock_notification when a product is
  added to the wishlist (to avoid the situation of notificaton emails
  accidentally shooting out when the cron is re-enabled).

Note that when the module is uninstalled, the disabled cron should
manually be set back to active as necessary.
