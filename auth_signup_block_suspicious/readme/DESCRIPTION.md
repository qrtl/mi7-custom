This module does the following:

- Blocks signup attempts with suspicious names (i.e. 'http' is
  included).

This is to block malicious operators from sending out their phishing
URLs to random email addresses through Odoo (with
auth_signup_verify_email installation) - they may set their URL to the
name field of the signup page, which sends out an email (with a signup
token) to the specified email address.
