This module does the following:

- Blocks signup attempts with suspicious names (i.e. 'http' is included).

This is to block malicious operators from sending out their phishing URLs to random
email addresses through Odoo (with auth_signup_verify_email installation) - they may
set their URL to the name field of the signup page, which sends out an email (with a
signup token) to the specified email address.
